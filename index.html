<section> <!--Main Information-->
    <h3>Use your Resouces!</h3>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Learn as much you can about the different types of conditions that affect those around us as well as ourselves. Such as anxiety or depression which can be a silent illness that displays itself in many different ways. Resources could include the internet, books, your local doctors and even a friend or family member. You never know what taking a moment to search might bring up. </p>
    <h3>Plan! Create!</h3>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Help to develop happy healing methods you and others can use.A "Happy healing method" is any positive activity done to promote a happy and healthy mindset. It can be anything from painting. creating music or just spending time chatting with someone you trust. We’ve all got events in our lives we need a little healing from, and when we start to heal we do just a little more than putting ourselves back together, we’re taking steps to protect our mind, body, heart, and soul. We also begin to use happy healing methods that help to improve our mental state and maintaining those methods can be key to helping us heal a lot faster when life gets a little rough. Setting a routine and practicing those methods regularly can also serve as a sign for when we may be headed down a dark path and need to take it a step further and seek greater help.
